Using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, please build a floating navigation with the following requirements:

 

1.                   Make the page responsive.

2.                   The menu will need to float to the right and be on top of all page content.

3.                   The menu should be hidden until the end user scrolls down the page. (You can set the distance on that)

4.                   Once visible the menu should stay fixed to the page as the user continues to scroll towards the bottom.

5.                   When the user scrolls back to the top the menu should hide itself.

6.                   When the page is viewed on a mobile device this functionality should not be present at all.
